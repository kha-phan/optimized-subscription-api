## The briefly outlines for optimization choices focus has been on improving the efficiency and scalability of database interactions.

### 1. Indexing for Efficient Data Retrieval:

Using index for quickly retrieving data include
- Single-column index: `idx_users_username`, `idx_users_email` on `users` table
- Single-column index: `idx_plans_name` on `subscription_plans` table
- Composite index: `idx_user_subscriptions_user_id_status`, `idx_user_subscriptions_status_end_date` on `user_subscriptions` table

### 2. Optimized Queries for Common Operations:

- `/subscriptions/active/optimized` endpoint: The query used in this endpoint directly leverages the `idx_user_subscriptions_user_id_status` index by filtering on user_id and is_active = True. 
This ensures a fast lookup of the current active subscription for an authenticated user.
- `/subscriptions/history/optimized` endpoint: The query demonstrates how raw SQL can be used for potential performance gains in more complex scenarios. 
By explicitly defining the JOIN condition, the WHERE clause, and selecting only necessary columns, we can sometimes achieve better query execution plans.
